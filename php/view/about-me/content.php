        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Geoff. I'm currently training to be a Web Developer under the <a href="scs-scheme">Scion
                Coalition Scheme with Netmatters</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have several years of experience working on a self-employed basis. I have managed my own projects
            alongside
            volunteering to support others. Over this time, I have realised my passion for helping people, this
            allows me
            to provide an excellent level of customer service. I present myself in a professional manner, enjoy
            learning
            and always aim to complete all tasks to the best of my ability. I believe the skills, knowledge and
            experience
            I have will make me ideally suited to the role.
